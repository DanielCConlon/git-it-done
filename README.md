# section 6.2

Collect user input to form HTTP requests.

Use an HTTP request's response to display data to the user.

Handle errors that may occur when working with server-side APIs.

# Section 6.3

Define request and response headers

Use additional GitHub API endpoints

Learned that request and response headers contain additional information about the request, separate from the data itselfâ€”like GitHub's Link header that lets you know there are more pages of results to request.

Leveraged a new GitHub API endpoint to request more specific data, using an optional ? string to change how results are sorted.

# Section 6.4

Pass information from one page to another using query parameters

Obtain data from a URL using browser-provided location objects

Make the API call dynamic by using the query parameter to alter the request
