# section 6.2

Collect user input to form HTTP requests.

Use an HTTP request's response to display data to the user.

Handle errors that may occur when working with server-side APIs.

# Section 6.3

Define request and response headers

Use additional GitHub API endpoints

Learned that request and response headers contain additional information about the request, separate from the data itself—like GitHub's Link header that lets you know there are more pages of results to request.

Leveraged a new GitHub API endpoint to request more specific data, using an optional ? string to change how results are sorted.

# Section 6.4

Pass information from one page to another using query parameters

Obtain data from a URL using browser-provided location objects

Make the API call dynamic by using the query parameter to alter the request

Pass information from one page to another with query parameters (much like you did with the GitHub API call).

Read from the query string and redirect the page with the document.location object.

Create a dynamic API call based on a user selection.

# Section 6.5

We'll leverage past experience by completing the following tasks:

Use data-\* attributes for the buttons.

Implement event delegation when clicking buttons.

Add query string parameters to the GitHub API’s URLs.

In this lesson, we'll accomplish the following:

Recognize which options are available for GitHub API endpoints.

Use multiple parameters in a query string.

Use HTML attributes to dynamically update an API call.

# Learned through out the lesson

Learned that a server-side API is an interface for accessing another website's data.

Familiarized yourself with how to read server-side API documentation.

Used the browser's Fetch API to make requests to a server-side API.

Gleaned additional information about requests being made, using the DevTools Network tab.

Captured user input from the browser to create dynamic HTTP requests.

Learned how to use an HTTP request’s response to display data to a user.

Learned how to handle errors that may occur when working with server-side APIs.

Learned that request and response headers contain additional information about the request separate from the data itself. For example, GitHub's Link header lets you know there are more pages of results to request.

Leveraged another GitHub API endpoint to request more specific data. This endpoint also used an optional ? string to change how results are sorted.

Used query parameters to pass information from one page to another.

Used the document.location object to read from a URL query string.
